    <string name="Maharogi_Sewa_Samiti">Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora is a non-profitable organisation in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra, India. It was established in 1949 to help socially disadvantaged people enhance their livelihood capabilities through self-discovery and empowering them to contribute to society.\n\nThe internationally known human rights activist Baba Amte founded MSS, Warora to better the plight of the marginalized leprosy afflicted and people with disabilities through treatment, training and active inducement in self- managed communes. MSS, Warora has been a pioneer in medical treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients in the world. Till date, more than 2.6 million people have benefited from our services. Our work spans a wide spectrum of activities ranging from the provision of basic healthcare and rehabilitation, development of land and water resources, enhancement of income and sustainable livelihoods, imparting formal and vocational education and sensitization of youth on environmental and socio-economic issues. MSS, Warora strives to couple innovative tools and technology with these activities for environment-friendly means of coexistence. It is fast becoming a focal point from where the quintessence of new paradigms of social work and developmental activities is spreading far and wide. The institution has grown over the last six decades to become an internationally renowned institution and perhaps the largest community of leprosy afflicted and people with disabilities in the world. His legacy continues to this date through the various projects of MSS, Warora.</string>
    <string name="fromStonesToMileStones">Anandwan, through its multiple projects and diverse initiatives in healthcare, formal and vocational education, agriculture, development of land and water resource, employment, empowerment and youth sensitization, not only achieved self-sustaining economy but helped people to regain their self-respect. It brought smiles to millions of faces</string>

    <string name="AnandwanDescription">Anandwan was established in 1949 by Baba Amte with a hope of giving marginalised people a dignified life through self-reliance and restoring a sense of belonging which they had lost due to the ill treatment at the hands of society.\n\nAnandwan is located in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra. \nWe believe that self-reliance and pride in one’s existence are very essential to lead a meaningful life. Baba Amte established Anandwan with a few leprosy patients and some savings.</string>
    <string name="AnandwanAslide">Our mission is to bring back hope to those who have been shunned from society. Creating a sense of belonging through collective effort and providing people access to better healthcare facilities, quality education and an occupation of their choice, we give them the right and means to lead a successful life.</string>
    <string name="AnandwanBslide">Initiatives in healthcare, education, agriculture and agro-industries, small and medium scale industrial units, renewable energy and conservation have been taken up by MSS. Anandwan can be termed as the Center for Rural Innovation and Incubation because a wide range of activities have been undertaken here over the years that have also been replicated in many villages across Maharashtra, such as construction of Nubian vault houses and man made lakes among many others.</string>
    <string name="AnandwanBottom">Anandwan aspires to become a Smart village. The SMART (Sustainable, Measurable, Affordable, Replicable and Technologically advanced) village model is a holistic approach towards development for improved quality of life and standard of living for all our citizens. We hope to serve as a benchmark for all villages in the future.</string>
    <string name="Hemalkasadescription">The Lok Biradari Prakalp (LBP) was started on 23rd December 1973 by Baba Amte for the integrated development of the primitive tribe \'Madia-Gonds\' in the Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra.\n\nThe \'Madia-Gond\' tribe lives in remote parts of the district, deep in the forests. Apart from the dangers of living in the wild, where animal attacks are very common, malaria and cholera epidemics were also a frequent occurrence. The Madia-Gonds did not have access to basic healthcare facilities which made the situation even worse.</string>
    <string name="HemalkasaAslide">Dr. Prakash Amte and his wife Dr. Mandakini Amte volunteered to work among the Madias. Gradually building trust with the tribe and providing free healthcare assistance and basic education to their children, Lok Biradari Prakalp has come a long way. Today, with a multi-speciality hospital, a hostel school which has created engineers and doctors and livelihood opportunities for the tribes, LBP has got the Madia-Gonds into the mainstream.</string>
    <string name="HemalkasaBslide">Dr. Prakash Amte saved the wild animals from man’s cruelty by starting the ‘Animal Ark’, an animal orphanage that started with an orphaned baby monkey and has now blossomed into a home for leopards, snakes, hyenas. At one point the shelter also had a lion.</string>
    <string name="HemalkasaBottom">For their efforts for the Madia-Gonds, Dr. Prakash Amte and Dr. Mandakini Amte were honoured with the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2008. We will continue to work towards successfully implementing all our initiatives and developing and creating new ways to improve lives!</string>
    <string name="somnathDescription">Baba Amte established Somnath in 1967 on 1200 acres of land allotted by the Govt. of Maharashtra in the Tadoba buffer zone to rehabilitate leprosy afflicted patients from Anandwan. As a result, agriculture and other livelihood opportunities were set up at Somnath to facilitate employment for the rehabilitated individuals. Baba hoped to make every village sustainable and every farmer’s life easier.</string>
    <string name="somnathAslide">Today, Somnath is our agricultural backbone and is often called as the ‘Food Bowl of MSS, Warora’. With a focus on Agrarian development, Somnath has successfully executed various environmental and water conservation initiatives. Besides, a check dam constructed with waste rubber tyres and plastic is one of our most successful initiatives towards becoming environmentally sustainable. In addition, a few man made lakes have been dug here.</string>
    <string name="somnathBslide">Every year in the month of May, we conduct our annual ‘Shramsanskar Chavni’, a 10 day long event that aims to inculcate and instill important values like work ethics, punctuality, time management, teamwork etc. in the campers. This camp is very popular, attracting more than 500 people every year.</string>
    <string name="somnathbottom">We aspire to be an inspiration to villages by implementing various environmental and sustainable farming initiatives while concurrently being a leader in educational, healthcare and livelihood promotion.</string>
    <string name="mulgavandescription">Mulgavan, a village in the Yavatmal District of Maharashtra is infamous for farmer suicides. The primary source of income for the people in this region is agriculture and agro related activities. Poor monsoons have forced the farmer to take his own life as he cannot feed his family, let alone the cattle.</string>
    <string name="mulgavanslide">The Gramin Vikas Prakalp (A Centre for Social Action) was set up for the betterment of the people living in the Mulgavan village and its adjoining areas. Apart from providing free healthcare services, the project also conducts various vocational training programmes with an aim to lower the dependency on agriculture. Basic facilities such as housing, water, etc. are also provided to the villagers.</string>
    <string name="mulgavanbottom">Seminars are conducted here from time to time, to educate farmers in the proper technique of farming. We plan to start an Agriculture Polytechnic College here from the academic year 18-19.</string>
    <string name="FSTMTSSHeading">Now Anandwan is a world-renowned award winning co-operative village carved out of barren land where unity, peace and harmony reign supreme.</string>
    <string name="FSTMSTSSdescription"><![CDATA[Anandwan, through its multiple projects and diverse initiatives in healthcare, formal and vocational education, agriculture, development of land and water resource, employment, empowerment and youth sensitization, not only achieved self-sustaining economy but helped people to regain their self-respect. It brought smiles to millions of faces coming from darkest corners of the life. Baba’s indomitable spirit and extraordinary determination proved to the world that there is “a sound mind in an unsound body”. Baba Amte & Dr Vikas Amte transformed a barren land into an oasis, which today is a home for around 2500 people including leprosy survivors, physically challenged, orphans, destitute and people who had lost hope to survive. For decades, people here are working together with an endless motivation & a shared dream. The people, once rejected by the healthy society, are now socially independent and are setting global standards for rehabilitation, socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Now Anandwan is a world-renowned award winning co-operative village carved out of barren land where unity, peace and harmony reign supreme. Close to seven decades of Anandwan’s experience in innovation and successfully implementation of socially, environmentally and economically sustainable projects, makes it well positioned to drive the process of creating a blueprint for village development for everyone and anyone to replicate. The rock solid determination to learn and implement even the most complex ideas have ensured that Anandwan stays ahead of its times & now aspires to become the first SMART village of India.]]></string>


    <string name="livelihood">Agriculture was the primary occupation at Anandwan before the inspiring stories of recovery and rehabilitation spread, and the number of patients began to rapidly increase. This led to a direct increase in Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora’s economic burden. To compensate for the increasing need for jobs as well as to reduce the economic burden of the organisation, Baba decided to expand the range of economic activities undertaken here. MSS, Warora has always prided itself for being an organization that focuses on holistic wellness. Regardless of disease or disability, everyone here can find employment. The spectrum of opportunities here is very wide and ranges from agriculture to management. This gives the residents here the freedom of choice and a chance to work in their field of interest.</string>
    <string name="handloom">The handlooms were one of the first industrial ventures started at Anandwan. Baba Amte always dreamt of Anandwan being self-sufficient and the handlooms allowed us to begin production of gauze and bandages for the hospital and clothes for our residents. Currently, 26 differently abled (mostly blind) and Rehabilitated leprosy afflicted including 7 women are working on making ‘Shabnam’ bags, personal mats, bedsheets, rugs (Galichas), blankets, towel, napkins, ‘panchas’, ‘lungis’, shirting etc. The first class quality and goodwill ensures immense demand, and various well-wishers of Anandwan use these materials for special occasions and in their daily lives.</string>
    <string name="powerloom">To improve scope of the cottage industries at Anandwan, it was imperative to increase productivity of the existing units. With this thought in mind, Baba decided to upgrade to a powerloom to increase cloth production. This helped in meeting the need of the organization besides facilitating generation of revenue by sale of the surplus produce. The extraordinary success of this industry in fact helped bridge the significant gap between the outside world and Anandwan.</string>
    <string name="satranjicarpents">The Satranji Carpets department was established in 1975 with the idea of expanding the existing industries while taking into consideration what the rehabilitated leprosy afflicted can do. 68 threads are criss crossed in a 1 foot width on a 50 foot vertical ‘tana’ threads and horizontal ‘bana’ threads to create beautiful colourful Satranji Carpets. The machines as well as the wooden instruments used in the production process are all made in-house. According to the demand, size, colours and design are customised which makes them very popular in the market.</string>
    <string name="bagcushion">Starting new ventures and replicating them if successful is Anandwan’s motto. The bag and cushion section is a golden example of the same. Baba Amte had once received a leather bag as a gift from the Birlas. It was perfectly replicated by an artist and in 1985 an independent Bag and cushion section was established. Leather purses, bags, backpacks, office bags, cushions etc. are made here. 8 differently abled workers are engaged in manufacture here and they work with the help of sewing machines.</string>
    <string name="metal">The metal fabrication department was established alongside Anandwan’s ‘Tin Can Project’, a project where cans to store goods were made out of tin. The department went from strength to strength, first satisfying the residents demand, and subsequently taking orders. One of the biggest successes of this department is the 3-wheeled cycle. Other than that, some of the work taking place in the metal fabrication department currently includes, beds, around 100 cupboards, drums to store grains, items made of tin, making chairs as well as any weaving required to manufacture the chairs, welding etc</string>
    <string name="carpentry">Baba Amte insisted that everything needed for MSS, Warora should be made in MSS, Warora. Some of the rehabilitated patients had some experience in carpentry, and so, the equipment and wood required for the new residences began to be made here. Some of the things made here include the framework for construction, doors, and windows and before the metal fabrication department was established, even the beds, tables and cupboards were made here. This department is also involved with a lot of repair work.</string>
    <string name="woodart">A unique blend of art and skill, our wood art department is both awe-inspiring as well as thought provoking. Mr. Chandramani Maharana, a former Naxalite who lost his arm in a struggle against the police, is responsible for nurturing this department. He came to Anandwan after contracting leprosy and even made himself a wooden artificial limb to aid him in his work! Today, the wood art department has been handed over to Mr. Govinda Khopde. His USP is his bottle art and intricate carvings he makes out of a single piece of wood. Our Wood Art department is unique because no trees are cut in the name of art. However, the items found here are not for sale. Baba believed that the art found here is priceless and one cannot put a price on art.</string>
    <string name="printingpress">Anandwan has a full-fledged printing press that prints notebooks, record books for Schools and Colleges run by Maharogi Sewa Samiti and all the stationery required by the Institution.</string>
    <string name="shoemaking">Rehabilitated leprosy afflicted patients require special footwear. Baba came up with an innovative idea to utilize waste tires for manufacturing footwear. Subsequently, chappals began to be made with MCR, a very soft material which refined the quality of the footwear. These chappals are created without the use of nails thus preventing exacerbation of wounds. MCR footwear is also advised for diabetic patients rendering a huge demand for this product. The school for vocational training- Sandhiniketan also imparts training to youth interested in learning this art.</string>
    <string name="livelihoodconstruction">MSS, Warora is an ever-growing organization. A dedicated construction team looks after all expansion projects and ensures quality and commitment.</string>
    <string name="postermaking">Recycled plastic and agricultural waste is used for making posters. Other non-biodegradable objects like used saline bottles, cold drink bottle caps, guthka wrappers, cigarette packets are used to make chandeliers, different craftworks, etc. This department is headed by Mr. Gani Chhaware, an artist who uses dried banana leaves, rice husks, and corn coverings to capture minute facial details of many famous personalities and makes masterful portraits without the use of colour. All 10 of the artists working here are either differently abled or cured leprosy patients and create more than 30 different designs and a 100 posters every month.</string>
    <string name="greetingcard">Greeting cards are a very personal and affectionate medium of expression. Dr. Vikas Amte established this department as a means for the residents of Anandwan to communicate and form a connection with the outside world as well as with each other. Organic substances like dried banana leaves, ripped clothes, dried barks, coloured paper, etc. are the main raw materials that are being used here amongst other waste material from the departments.</string>

    <string name="environment">Environment determines the quality of life. One cannot live a healthy life in absence of clean environment. Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora (MSS) recognised the value of environment early on and has been relentlessly working to minimise the impact of its development activities on surrounding environment. MSS believes in the philosophy of giving back much more to the environment than what is borrowed from it. This philosophy is distinctly visible at ‘Abhayaranya’, the forest sanctuary at Anandwan. A memorial was built in early 80s by the residents of Anandwan to commemorate the sacrifice of innumerable plants and trees for building Anandwan.\n \n

            Natural resources are an integral constituent of environment and MSS has been instrumental in developing innovative and replicable solutions for conservation of water, air, soil and fossil fuels. All of MSS’s initiatives are aimed at having a carbon neutral development.\n \n

            To address the menace of plastic, innovative techniques were developed in 70s to reuse plastic in construction material, construction of small check dams and manufacturing of beddings (pillow and mattress).</string>

    <string name="reservoir">The land on which Anandwan stands was originally barren, abandoned quarry with no surface water. Through the painstaking efforts by early rehabilitated residents, wells were dug to provide water for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes. Considering the growing requirement of water, reservoirs were built which helped in recharging ground water of the region thus providing water security even during a drought year. More than 30 reservoirs have been built across various project locations of MSS. These reservoirs apart from supplying and recharging water also offer reprieve to the surrounding flora and fauna.</string>
    <string name="checkdams">To enhance the catchment of reservoirs, small check dams were developed. These dams are low in cost and easy-to-build and are made using old tyres and plastic waste. With the help of these check dams’ water catchment of reservoirs has been enhanced manifold thus providing water security to the surrounding areas.</string>
    <string name="watertreatment">All the drains in Anandwan converge into two reservoirs, through a unique bio filtration system the water is treated and the fishes in the reservoir further cleanse the water thus allowing the water to be utilized for irrigation of farms. Also, sale of fishes creates livelihood opportunities.</string>
    <string name="abhyanarayan">Abhayaranya the manmade forest in Anandwan is a highly successful experiment of ‘rehabilitation of mines’. Once an arid rocky wasteland, here there is now a colossal biomass bank spread over 60 acres. It also serves and the burial ground for mortal corpse of Anandwan residents, thus fulfilling the philosophy of giving back as much to the environment. Over the years Abhayaranya has attracted a wide range of migratory birds which setup their nests in this oasis.</string>
    <string name="miyawaki">Dr. Akira Miyawaki’s method of afforestation involves planting a number of different species of native trees close to each other through a logical sequence. This method ensures that forests grows 10x faster, is 30x denser, 100x biodiverse and 100% organic. Close planting of many random trees in a small area, creates dense forest that enriches the green cover and reinforces richness of the land. This leads to co-existence of variety of plants at a time and in fact, each plant draws vital nutrients from the other to grow stronger and healthier.</string>
    <string name="plasticreuse">Plastic is collected through ‘Shramdaan’ (voluntary labour) from in and around Anandwan and after processing (washing and shredding) is used to make construction material like bricks, mixed with bitumen to make roads and also mixed with cotton to make bedding material like pillow and mattress.</string>
    <string name="handmadecardsandposters">Tremendous amount of biomass generated in the farms and forests is collected by the residents at various project locations of MSS. The biomass includes paddy straw, bamboo shoots, banana leaves, etc. These are dried, pressed and cut into intricate art forms and used for making exquisite cards and posters.</string>
    <string name="solar">The Vidarbha region in India is blessed with perfect geography for optimal utilization of solar energy. Various applications have been developed and deployed utilizing solar power for steam-based cooking, heating water and generating electricity to power utilities. In the year 2016, Anandwan was awarded the "Most Innovative Project of The Year" by American Association of Energy Engineers for implementing integrated solar based project in Anandwan. The solar project has significantly helped in reducing energy costs and has created a benchmark for other villages to replicate.</string>
    <string name="biogas">In the last few years price of cooking fuel (LPG) has been rapidly rising, this demanded search for cost effective and environment friendly alternative. With the ‘Mega Kitchen’ in Anandwan serving 2500 people per day and round the year, alternative to LPG had to be abundantly available. In 2013, after several month of due diligence, Biogas was chosen as the preferred option. An industrial plant was setup adjacent to ‘Mega Kitchen’ utilizing cow dung and kitchen waste to produce about 400 m3 of methane gas. The biogas plant at Anandwan is one of the largest single location setup in central India and helped Anandwan to reduce 70% of LPG requirement.</string>


    <string name="s_agriculture">What started at Anandwan with 50 acres of barren quarry land, no water and no prospects is now a huge agricultural venture spread across all MSS, Warora projects. Anandwan uses around 50 acres for agriculture and Somnath uses a mammoth share of its land, more than 600 acres for agriculture.\n \n

            MSS, Warora undertakes Intensive Modern Farming. The farms here produce a huge variety of food crops. These include soy, paddy, tur, wheat, eggplant, spinach, fenugreek, tomatoes, radishes, chilly, cabbage, oranges, bananas, guavas and mangoes to name a few. The farms employ low-input, organic farming techniques including intercropping and crop rotation to maintain sustainable and affordable agricultural systems. Despite being in the Vidharba region of Maharashtra, infamous for its drought prone conditions and farmer suicides, agriculture at MSS, Warora thrives due to various sustainable farming techniques and water management systems like the check dams and man-made lakes.</string>
    <string name="floriculture">MSS, Warora has always been ahead of the curve. Happiness and mental health are valued along with dignity of labour and life. Flowers are cultivated here with the idea that their beauty helps bring positivity and happiness to the entire field and to the village as a whole. It is smart economics as well. The demand for flowers is on the rise as its potential per hectare is more than field crops. Beautiful flowers like sunflowers, marigolds etc. are cultivated here.</string>
    <string name="horticulture">VEGETABLES - Self-sufficiency is what MSS, Warora aspires towards. Vegetables are primarily cultivated for internal consumption. The excess is sold in the local markets nearby. Many varieties of vegetables are grown here on an annual and seasonal basis like okra, eggplant, cucumber etc.\n \n

            FRUITS - Fruits are high on nutrients and it is important to include them in one’s diet. However, it is often an ignored part of a healthy diet. We cultivate various types of fruits like bananas, guavas and specially the famous Nagpur mandarins. For us, it is important to ensure that our residents get a balanced and quality diet.</string>

    <string name="fodder">The fodder provided to cattle directly influences the percentage of fat, protein and other nutrients in the milk. Dr. Vikas Amte started the ‘Rid the weed and plant the feed’ movement in Anandwan to begin cultivation for high protein fodder. This feed is special because it uses very little water to grow and results in phenomenal milk rich in nutrients.</string>
    <string name="grains">Agriculture was the primary focus when Anandwan was established as Baba aimed for MSS, Warora to be a self-sufficient organization. Considering most of the patients had an agricultural background, the land was cultivated with various grains. Modern agriculture is practiced. However, the farming methods used are sustainable in nature. Paddy cultivation is the primary focus, as it was traditionally grown here. Additionally grains like wheat, tur etc are also cultivated.</string>
    <string name="cotton">Fertile black cotton soil along with healthy water management and conservation systems like the check dams and man-made lakes make it possible for us to cultivate a water intensive crop in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra. High quality cotton is grown and then subsequently sold.</string>
    <string name="dairy">Anandwan’s dairy was established in 1951 when Baba Amte used Vinoba Bhave’s donation to buy 1 lame cow. This cow served to provide milk for the patients and fulfill their dietary requirements.\n \n

            The excess was sold with the hope of bringing Anandwan into contact with the outside world. Since then, the dairy has developed rapidly and expanded into one of our biggest departments. Regular milk testing for fat content, glucose, protein, water, minerals etc. is conducted here to maintain the purity of the milk. The natural waste in this department is used to create biogas.</string>

    <string name="aquacultureagri">Special fish are bred in the lake where bio-waste is deposited. The fish act on the matter and treat the water thus removing any harmful components and converting them into harmless material. This keeps the lake clean. These fish can also be consumed.</string>
    <string name="poultry">Chickens have been kept in the dairy. They eat insects, ticks etc and help maintain the health of the animals. They also produce eggs, which are then sold.</string>


    <string name="s_healthcare">Healthcare spearheads all the activities of Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora (MSS).It has always been and will remain the most significant pillar of MSS. What began as an attempt to provide holistic healthcare to the people affected by leprosy, has today, expanded into a large-scale project providing healthcare to all the marginalized sections of society.\n \n
            Treatment of disease is the primary focus, however, preventive healthcare and comprehensive attention to the patient’s socio- economic and psychological welfare which enables the individual to lead a healthy, productive and confident life forms a major portion of MSS’s healthcare philosophy.</string>
    <string name="sitaratan">Sita Ratan Leprosy Hospital started as a small dispensary in 1951 in Anandwan providing primary healthcare to the needy. Over the years it has evolved into a 50-bedded hospital offering free primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services to around 30,000 patients, mostly from rural interior regions in central India and belonging to very poor families.\n \n
            The hospital\'s main building was built in the year 2002 with funds generously donated by Mr. L.R. Gajaria and was named in memory of Mr. Gajaria’s parents. The hospital is equipped with operation theatre, recovery room, laboratory, digital X-ray unit, separate male and female IPD, medicine disbursement counter and administration cabins. Separate OPD wing with special area for dressing of patients affected by leprosy and a fully functioning dental unit was added to the hospital campus in the year 2014 with the financial assistance from Nouvelle Planete, Switzerland. A physiotherapy centre is also present in the hospital premise. All support staff of the hospital including nurses, dressers and attendants are cured leprosy afflicted persons.</string>
    <string name="lokbiradari">The Lok Biradari Prakalp (LBP), tribal project of MSS was established in the year 1973 at Hemalkasa with an aim to mainstream the tribal population, especially the Madia-Gond tribes. In the initial years primary healthcare services were rendered under a tree to the local population which was suffering from deadly diseases like cerebral malaria, malaria, tuberculosis, ascites, cancer and sickle cell anaemia. The tribal population was also victims of bear bites, burns, snake bites, scabies and severe malnutrition.\n \n
            The LBP Hospital was renovated in 2013 with the help of many donors with chief donor being Nouvelle Planete, Switzerland. The hospital caters to around 45,000 patients annually from 1,000 villages in a 250 km radius, including those from the neighbouring states of Chattisgarh and Telangana. The hospital offers free primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services. It has a 50 bedded IPD and is equipped with all modern diagnostic and interventional facilities like ultrasonography, X-ray, pathology lab, delivery room and operation theatres.</string>
    <string name="shirdi">Shirdi Sai Baba hospital offers free primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services to poor patients from nearby villages, people with disabilities and other residents of Anandwan. The hospital has 30 bedded IPD, OPD, three well-equipped operation theatres and a unit for making special artificial limbs for patients needing prosthetic care.\n \n
            All support staff of the hospital including nurses and attendants are cured leprosy afflicted persons. The hospital was setup in 1991 with financial support from Shri Sai Baba trust.</string>
    <string name="studenthealthprogram">Through School Health Awareness Program (SHAPE), children are taught the importance of maintaining overall hygiene and health. Protecting our surrounding environment is also stressed upon. The adolescents are taught lessons about changes in their body as they reach puberty. They are trained in basic first aid with focus on snakebites and fractures. Under preventive healthcare, the dangers of addiction especially alcohol and tobacco are also stressed upon in the children.</string>
    <string name="physiotherapy">Every year on the occasion of world physiotherapy day, students and professors from Government Medical College, Nagpur visit Anandwan and examine the patients afflicted by leprosy as well as other patients and prescribe exercises to relieve their pain and discomfort and help them to overcome their disability. Scanning, therapy- both manual and using machines, and exercises are prescribed by experts. Physiotherapy forms an integral part of healthcare service and expedites patients’ recuperation</string>
    <string name="sexualreproductionseminar">A reproductive health seminar for children of 12-14 age group, comprising of visually impaired, hearing impaired and normal children residing in rural areas is organized every year to create awareness about the reproductive system, menstruation, unwanted pregnancies, malnourished mother-child, and hygiene practices.</string>
    <string name="blooddonation">The students of various colleges run by MSS and residents of Anandwan routinely donate blood to help maintain a steady stock of blood supply in banks in case of any medical emergency especially in rural areas.</string>
    <string name="projecthaemoglob">Project "Haemoglobe" was launched under Baba Amte Bal Sakshmikaran program in collaboration with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), Warora. Blood samples were collected from girl students in various school in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra and analysed. A correlation between haemoglobin and menstrual history, economic condition, nutrition and household was established and the results are used to improve the heamoglobin levels in the girl child through health and socio-economic interventions.</string>
    <string name="dentalcamp">Oral hygiene is considered the first line of defence against most diseases and awareness of this is of utmost necessity. Dental clinics are routinely operated across various project locations of MSS. Additionally, dental camps are held every month treating around 100 patients per camp.</string>

    <string name="baba">Baba knew that simply curing the disease (leprosy) wasn’t enough. It was important to completely rehabilitate the people and change their mindsets. Due to the stigma attached with leprosy, the patients could not just be sent back into society to their old lives. It became important for them to create completely new lives. Baba gave them the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and come stay at Anandwan. A commune structure was adopted where two young couples and one older couple to stay in one home thus forming a traditional Indian joint-family. This way, family relations could be preserved and understood by those who were otherwise disowned by their blood relatives outside Anandwan. Right from hostels for the students, to communes and old age homes, MSS, Warora welcomes everyone regardless of age, gender, disability or disease.</string>
    <string name="snehsavali">Sneh Savali is an old age home that also takes responsibility for the bedridden. All the resident’s needs including and not limited to medicine, residence, food etc. are taken care of here. Snehsavali includes 4 buildings that follow a simple and pleasing pattern of comfortable individual rooms (some for men and some for women) and a garden in the middle of the building for the residents to enjoy. Baba Amte and Sadhana Tai came here everyday to meet and talk to the residents. To this day, Dr.Vikas Amte and his family, 3 generations after Baba meet the patients regularly.</string>
    <string name="apulki">A commune specially built for women, to give them a comfortable home and privacy. Apulki was established after sneh-savali started getting overcrowded. It was built using the money raised by the ‘Swaranandwan’ orchestra. The residents here are provided with electricity, housing, food water etc.</string>
    <string name="uttarayan">Home to about 50 people, Uttarayan is a commune mostly consisting of senior citizens. The residents here are provided with electricity, clothing, accomodation etc free of cost. The commune is fondly reffered to as a ‘Wisdom Bank’ by Dr. Vikas Amte.</string>
    <string name="krishiniketan">Krishi Niketan was established to give the married farmer couples a home. This commune was established as a part of the mukti sadan expansion plan. The concept of this commune was to give people residence near their place of work. The people here are provided housing, electricity, healthcare etc.</string>
    <string name="sukhsadan">This was the first commune established in Anandwan. The communes here were designed for the rehabilitated leprosy-afflicted and disabled people. Baba had arranged for two young couples and one older couple to stay in one home thus forming a traditional Indian joint-family. This way, family relations could be preserved and understood by those who were otherwise disowned by their blood relatives outside Anandwan. The joint-family structure ensures that the older couple can be taken care of by their “children”.</string>
    <string name="muktisadan">Literally means- House of freedom. The concept of this commune was to give people independence and residence near their workplace. The residents of this commune were usually involved in agriculture. The people are provided electricity, housing etc. The modules in the commune were built in the famous ‘nubian vault structure’ pattern and provide earthquake protection as well as some protection against the heat and cold.</string>
    <string name="mitangana">MSS, Warora encourages all kinds of inter-disability marriages. Those couples were generally housed at Mitrangan. More than 64 houses have been constructed here. The houses are nubian vault houses. Mitrangan literally means the ‘patio of friends’.</string>
    <string name="gokul">MSS, Warora believes in being there for those who have no- one. Gokul was established so orphaned children will have a home to call their own. Baba and Tai believed that everyone deserves a loving family and a sense of belonging and community. Not only are the children’s dietary requirements fulfilled, their educational and emotional needs are also looked after. When the children grow up, MSS, Warora also takes responsibility of rehabilitating these children into society and ensuring their well-being.</string>
    <string name="yuvagram">MSS, Warora has always worked towards the betterment of society. An effort to encourage the unemployed youth in the area to get training here and take their skills and knowledge to their own village became very successful. It became necessary to provide these youth with a place to stay and grow.</string>

    <string name="description">Murlidhar Devidas Amte popularly known as Baba Amte was born to an affluent Hindu Brahmin family on the 26th of December 1914 in Hinganghat, Wardha.\n\n

As a young boy, he enjoyed all the privileges that came with his familys wealth. However, at a very young age he became aware of the plight of the poor and the marginalised and often felt that he should do something to end this injustice.\n\n

Once, during Diwali he encountered a blind beggar and emptied his pocket full of coins into his begging bowl. The beggar, feeling the weight thought as though he was being made a fool of and exclaimed I am only a beggar young sir, dont put stones in my bowl, to which the boy responded Theyre coins, not stones. Count them if you wish.\n\n
    This incident left a deep, lasting impact on the boy. The idea that such misery could exist so close to his perfect world hit him hard. He regularly played witht the servants children despite his fathers disapproval. The rigidity that existed in his father’s world didnt appeal to him at all. He didnt understand why people manufactured so many ways to divide themselves.\n\n

He wished to become a doctor but was forced to become a lawyer by his father. He wanted his son to handle the family estate. For a while, Baba took to the life of an idyllic, wealthy young man very well. He spent his days horse riding, hunting and playing games of bridge and tennis at the local club. His car was decorated with the fur of the leopard he had shot. He was living an enviable life of the rich and privileged that only the fortunate get a chance to live.</string>


    <string name="descript">But underneath this extravagance, he was restless. He felt as though he must serve a bigger purpose in the world. He began to help and volunteer wherever possible and also became involved with the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by greats like Tagore, Gandhi and Sane Guruji. He also started working as a waste carrier to experience the hardships they experienced. During this time, he encountered a sight that would change his life forever\n\n
    \" A man in the last stage of leprosy. A rotting mass of human flesh with two holes in place of a nose, without traces of fingers or toes, with worms and sores where there should have been eyes. Literally a living corpse.\"\n\n

He ran away, terrified of the infection and of the sight he had seen. He had always thought of himself as being fearless and daring. The encounter with Tulshiram (the leprosy afflicted man) shattered his self-image. Even as he cared for the dying man this fear would not leave him.</string>
    <string name="des">I sought my soul, but
my soul I could not
see, I sought my god,
but my god eluded
me; And then I
sought my sisters
and my brothers, and
in them I found all
three.</string>


    <string name="desc">\"I had never been frightened of anything. Because I fought British tommies to save the honour of an Indian lady, Gandhiji called me \'Abhay Sadhak,\' fearless seeker of the truth. When the sweepers of Warora challenged me to clean the gutters, I did so but the same person quivered in fright when he saw the living corpse of Tulshiram.\"\n\n

For the next 6 months he lived in the unrelenting agony of this crisis. He was certain where there is fear, there is no love, and where there is no love, there is no God. There seemed only one way of overcoming this problem. He must live and work with the leprosy afflicted.\n\n

Baba Amte decided to take up the cause of serving leprosy patients for the very reason that he felt disgusted to be a part of a society that was so dispassionate towards the plight of such downtrodden human beings. He regarded this apathy as Mental Leprosy by aptly quoting that the most frightening disease is not losing ones limbs, but losing ones strength to feel kindness and compassion for other human beings.</string>


    <string name="descr">I dont want to be a
leader. I want to be
one who goes
around with a little
oil can and offer help
when I see a break-
down.
</string>

    <string name="descri">Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora (Leprosy Service Society) was established with the intention of treating leprosy patients and for society afflicted by mental leprosy.Baba chose to call this paradise Anandwan , meaning Forest of Bliss.\n

Baba Amte knew that simply curing the disease wasn’t enough. It was important to create a self-sufficient, productive society made of these social outcasts. Starting with agriculture and expanding to various small and medium scale industries right from textiles to wood work, MSS, Warora has grown into the productive haven of Babas dreams.\n

Established in 1949 with Rs.14, 6 leprosy patients and a lame cow, MSS, Warora has spread its work all over Maharashtra and many organizations have taken inspiration from Baba’s work and are working for the downtrodden across the country and even the entire world. The impact Baba Amte had across the world is immeasurable and a soul like his is a rare gem the world was lucky to have.</string>


    <string name="abc">Those abandoned by society and their families, find a home in Anandwan. They are not just physically cared, but mentally boosted by the groundwork of love that Baba has laid. With the sole purpose of enabling leprosy affected as well as other handicaps such as blind, deaf and mute to overcome poverty and prejudice, livelihood opportunities are provided. Through social and economic rehabilitation, they regain their dignity, contribute to the economy and find a respectable place in the community.</string>

    <string name="xyz">In line with Mahatma Gandhi philosophy, Anandwan has become completely self-sufficient. It was the thought of fulfilling the rational and reasonable needs of the residents that Baba and Dr . Vikas Amte harnessed the latent talent of able minds with feeble bodies to start various cottage industries. The social entrepreneurship, which is now a trending term, has always been encouraged in Anandwan. Most of our industries help mitigate waste by utilizing it as a resource helping the environment in the process.</string>

    <string name="pqr">Our metal Fabrication industry came to rise when the waste Oil TIN cans were re-used and re-molded into kitchen utensils like strainers and spice boxes. The Carpet manufacturing unit was introduced to make rugs and carpets as floor coverings for the residents to sleep on. Hand crafted greeting cards section was started as a means of communication with our friends, supporters and well-wishers. Footwear was made for our leprosy patients by reusing aircraft tires because of their protective nature. Introduction of powerloom helped meet the demand of the bandages needed in our hospitals.\n\n

We have treated the mental leprosy by showcasing that leprosy affected people are not just important elements to our society but are now socially independent and have gone to create a benchmark for self-sustaining villages. Yesterday liabilities have thus become today assets not just for Anandwan but for the entire world!

    <string name="vol">\"Literally...Anandwan is a Forest of Joy". Sandhiniketan where I work is a "Home of Opportunity\"...\n

Anandwan has given me a big canvas of \"Sandhiniketan\" with various color shades of differently abled children, allowing me to
develop my passion for teaching without any boundaries. I have found a new way of life.\n Working with our deaf, blind
and physically challenged children, I get pleasantly surprised daily looking at their positive attitude and finding joy in
small things. Every day in Anandwan teaches you something that will help you lead a meaningful life\n

This has been an \"Experience of a Lifetime for me!\"</string>


    <string name="volun">We deeply appreciate and value our volunteers  time and efforts and always look forward to welcoming genuine people on board. Your skills, energy and experience will help us strive forward to better ourselves each day and in turn provide you with the most rewarding, emotional and spiritual life journey that will surely change your perspective on life in a positive way!</string>

    <string name="ssc">The idea of How to build or develop a man found its roots when Baba saw the emptiness of the supple minds of youth, who were being pushed away from the idea of living a community centered and development oriented life due to prevailing socio-economic conditions and education system. Baba would always argue that if people affected with leprosy and other disabilities could carve out an oasis out of barren land and pioneer the paradigms of development, then why cant people especially the youngsters who have able minds and bodies build a modern responsible and inclusive nation.\n\n

        The solution was to kindle the young hearts by channelling their anxieties, desperation and raw energy on the path of development.</string>

    <string name="ssc2">This vision came to realization through Shram Sanskar Chhavani which Baba often refered to as a factory for transforming youngsters into sensitive, responsible, development oriented citizens. This was achieved by instilling the value of hard labor in their hearts and minds.</string>
    <string name="ss">The camp started in 1967 and till date has more than 40,000 youths all over India and the world. It has pioneered various youth empowerment programs in India. It is believed that 4 out of 10 social workers, activists and entrepreneurs in Maharashtra have attended the camp at some point of time in their youth. Additionally, thousands of past campers have imbibed the learnings from the camp to excel in their respective professions like medicine, engineering, governance and research</string>

    <string name="sscc">"Shram Sanskar Chhavani" is a week-long annual boot camp where young boys and girls from all over the country congregate, make friends, get sensitized and work in harmony with nature, building check dams, cultivating barren land, cleaning forests and digging lakes through Shramadan (hard labor). Working together, regardless of caste, creed and religion, helps them to develop empathy, secular values, national integration and sensitization towards the marginalized section of society and environment. Participants learn about current and potential challenges confronting the society and are encouraged to ideate and develop sustainable solution through interaction with their peers and subject matter experts on topics ranging from education, health care, livelihoods, agriculture, rural development and environmental conservation.</string>

    <string name="description_text">Anandwan literally, Forest of happiness, located around 5 kilometers from Warora in Chandrapur district in the state of Maharashtra, India, is an ashram and a community rehabilitation centre which was mainly started for leprosy patients and the disabled from downtrodden sections of society.
        It was founded in 1952 by noted social activist Baba Amte.</string>
    <string name="desc_1">The project is run by the organisation Maharogi Seva Samiti.
        Two of its other projects are Lok Biradari Prakalp and Somnath, a village for cured leprosy patients.
        Baba Amte developed Anandwan to be a self-contained ashram (which could be described as a kibbutz for the sick).
        Today residents are self-sufficient in terms of basic subsistence.</string>
    <string name="desc_2">  In addition the ashram has various home-based, small-scale industry units run by the residents that generate income to cover additional requirements.
         Baba Amte also shaped Anandwan as an environmentally aware community to practice energy utilization, waste recycling and minimizing use of natural resources that might otherwise lead to their depletion.</string>
    <string name="desc_3">  Anandwan today has two hospitals, a college, an orphanage, a school for the blind, a school for the deaf and a technical wing.
        Dr. Vikas Amte, Baba Amtes elder son, is the chief functionary at Anandwan.
        He undertook various experiments in Anandwan regarding rehabilitation which have been mentioned in a book titled Anandwan Prayogwan. </string>

 Anandwan uses around <b>50 acres</b> for agriculture and Somnath uses a mammoth share of its land, more than <b>600 acres</b> for agriculture.</string>

    <string name="agr_2">MSS, Warora undertakes <b>Intensive Modern Farming</b>. The farms here produce a huge variety of food crops. These include soya, paddy, tur, wheat, eggplant, spinach,

    <string name="hea_4"><b>Sita Ratan Leprosy Hospital</b>started as a small dispensary in 1951 in Anandwan providing primary healthcare to the needy. Over the years it has evolved into a
<b>50-bedded hospital</b> offering free primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services to around <b>30,000 patients</b>, mostly from rural interior regions in central
 India and belonging to very poor families.
The hospitals main building was built in the <b>year 2002</b> with funds generously donated by <b>Mr. L.R. Gajaria</b> and was named in memory of Mr. Gajaria’s parents.
</string>

    <string name="hea_5">The hospital is equipped with operation theatre, recovery room, laboratory, digital X-ray unit, separate male and female IPD, medicine disbursement counter and
 administration cabins. Separate OPD wing with special area for dressing of patients affected by leprosy and a fully functioning dental unit was added to the
hospital campus in the year 2014 with the financial assistance from <b>Nouvelle Planete, Switzerland</b>. A physiotherapy centre is also present in the hospital premise.
All support staff of the hospital including nurses, dressers and attendants are cured leprosy afflicted persons.
</string>

    <string name="hea_6"><b>Shirdi Sai Baba hospital</b> offers free primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services to poor patients from nearby villages, people with disabilities and
other residents of Anandwan. The hospital has 30 bedded IPD, OPD, three well-equipped operation theatres and a unit for making special artificial limbs for
patients needing prosthetic care.
</string>

    <string name="hea_7">All support staff of the hospital including nurses and attendants are cured leprosy afflicted persons. The hospital was setup in <b>1991</b> with financial support
from <b>Shri Sai Baba trust</b>.
</string>

    <string name="jou_1">Murlidhar Devidas Amte popularly known as <b>Baba Amte</b> was born to an affluent Hindu Brahmin family on the <b>26th of December 1914</b> in <b>Hinganghat, Wardha</b>.
As a young boy, he enjoyed all the privileges that came with his family’s wealth.
However, at a very young age he became aware of the plight of the poor and the marginalised and often felt that he should do something to end this injustice.
</string>

    <string name="jou_2">Once, during Diwali he encountered a <b>blind beggar</b> and emptied his pocket full of coins into his begging bowl.
 The beggar, feeling the weight thought as though he was being made a fool of and exclaimed : I am only a beggar young sir, don’t put stones in my bowl,
 to which the boy responded : They’re coins, not stones. Count them if you wish.
</string>

    <string name="jou_3">This incident left a deep, lasting impact on the boy. The idea that such misery could exist so close to his perfect world hit him hard.
 He regularly played with the servants children despite his fathers disapproval. The rigidity that existed in his father’s world didn’t appeal to him at all.
 He didnt understand why people manufactured so many ways to divide themselves.
</string>

    <string name="jou_4">He wished to become a doctor but was forced to become a <b>lawyer</b> by his father. He wanted his son to handle the family estate. For a while,
 Baba took to the life of an idyllic, wealthy young man very well. He spent his days horse riding, hunting and playing games of bridge and tennis at the local club.
 His car was decorated with the fur of the leopard he had shot. He was living an enviable life of the rich and privileged that only the fortunate get a chance to live.
</string>

    <string name="jou_5">But underneath this extravagance, he was restless. He felt as though he must serve a bigger purpose in the world. He began to help and volunteer wherever possible and
 also became involved with the <b>freedom struggle</b>. He was deeply influenced by greats like Tagore, Gandhi and Sane Guruji.
He also started working as a waste carrier to experience the hardships they experienced. During this time, he encountered a sight that would change his life forever -
: <b>A man in the last stage of leprosy</b>. A rotting mass of human flesh with two holes in place of a nose, without traces of fingers or toes,
with worms and sores where there should have been eyes. Literally a living corpse.
He ran away, terrified of the infection and of the sight he had seen. He had always thought of himself as being fearless and daring.
 The encounter with <b>Tulshiram (the leprosy afflicted man)</b> shattered his self-image. Even as he cared for the dying man this fear would not leave him.
</string>

    <string name="jou_6">"I had never been frightened of anything. Because I fought British tommies to save the honour of an Indian lady, Gandhiji called me <b>Abhay Sadhak</b>, fearless seeker of the truth. When the sweepers of Warora challenged me to clean the gutters, I did so; but the same person quivered in fright when he saw the living corpseof Tulshiram. For the next 6 months he lived in the unrelenting agony of this crisis. He was certain "where there is fear, there is no love, and where there is no love,
 there is no God. There seemed only one way of overcoming this problem. He must live and work with the leprosy afflicted.
</string>

    <string name="jou_7">Baba Amte decided to take up the cause of serving leprosy patients for the very reason that he felt disgusted to be a part of a society that was so dispassionate
 towards the plight of such downtrodden human beings. He regarded this apathy as <b>Mental Leprosy</b> by aptly quoting that the most frightening disease is not losing
ones limbs, but losing one’s strength to feel kindness and compassion for other human beings.
</string>

    <string name="som_1"> Haath lage nirmaan mein, nahi mangne, nahi maarne. (Use your hands to create, not to beg, not to harm) - Baba Amte.
The idea of <b>‘How to build/develop a man”</b> found its roots when Baba saw the emptiness of the supple minds of youth, who were being pushed away from the idea
of living a community centered and development oriented life due to prevailing socio-economic conditions and education system.

\n \n Baba would always argue that if people affected with leprosy and other disabilities could carve out an oasis out of barren land and pioneer the paradigms of development, then why can’t
people especially the youngsters who have able minds and bodies build a modern responsible and inclusive nation.
</string>

    <string name="som_2">The solution was to kindle the young hearts by channelling their anxieties, desperation and raw energy on the path of development.
This vision came to realization through <b>“Shram Sanskar Chavani”</b> which Baba often refered to as a factory for transforming youngsters into sensitive, responsible,
development oriented citizens. This was achieved by instilling the value of hard labor in their hearts and minds.
</string>

    <string name="som_3"> Shram Sanskar Chhavani is a week-long annual <b>boot camp</b> where young boys and girls from all over the country congregate, make friends, get sensitized and
 work in harmony with nature, building check dams, cultivating barren land, cleaning forests and digging lakes through <b>Shramadan</b> (hard labor).
 Working together, regardless of caste, creed and religion, helps them to develop empathy, secular values, national integration and sensitization towards
the marginalized section of society and environment.</string>

    <string name="som_4">Participants learn about <b>current and potential challenges</b> confronting the society and are encouraged to
ideate and develop sustainable solution through interaction with their peers and subject matter experts on topics ranging from education, health care, livelihoods,
 agriculture, rural development and environmental conservation.
</string>

    <string name="som_5">The camp started in <b>1967</b> and till date has more than <b>40,000</b> youths all over India and the world. It has pioneered various youth empowerment programs in India.
It is believed that 4 out of 10 social workers, activists and entrepreneurs in Maharashtra have attended the camp at some point of time in their youth.
Additionally, thousands of past campers have imbibed the learnings from the camp to excel in their respective professions like medicine, engineering, governance
 and research.

    <string name="work_1"> Maharogi Sewa Samiti, Warora (Leprosy Service Society) was established with the intention of treating leprosy patients and for society afflicted by mental leprosy.
Baba chose to call this paradise Anandwan, meaning <b>Forest of Bliss</b>.
Baba Amte knew that simply curing the disease wasnt enough. </string>

    <string name="work_2">It was important to create a self-sufficient, productive society made of these social outcasts.
Starting with <b>agriculture</b> and expanding to various small and medium scale industries right from textiles to wood work, MSS, Warora has grown into the <b>productive
heaven</b> of Babas dreams.</string>

    <string name="work_3">Established in 1949 with <b>Rs.14</b>, <b>6 leprosy patients</b> and a lame cow, MSS, Warora has spread its work all over Maharashtra and many organizations have taken
inspiration from Babas work and are working for the downtrodden across the country and even the entire world. The impact Baba Amte had across the world is

    <string name="abhy_2">
        Abhayaranya is spread over 60-65 acres of beautiful man-made but diverse landscape with a rich biodiversity. The land here was completely overrun by rock mines
and was thus completely barren. Dr. Vikas Amte felt the need to completely rehabilitate this land and give it new life. However this land was forest land and
belonged to the government when a request was made to acquire this land the government show the willingness to hand it over. Dr.Vikas Amte created a rough draft of his
vision and began working towards building an entirely new ecosystem in place of the barren lands. The entire quarry was filled using soil which was put on a plastic
base. Trees creepers flowering plants and vegetables were planted to build this ecosystem. Today this entire region which was once barren is now a beautiful dense
forest with an enviable ecosystem.
    </string>

    <string name="abhy_3">
       Peacocks, wolves, jackals, wildcats, parrots, neelgais, wild boars, rabbits, ducks and a variety of snakes including pythons can be found here. When abhayaranya
was established, and had deer, monkey, neelgai, crocodiles,etc. But later, these animals were handed over to the forest department. Currently, we have ducks, emus,
chickens, pigeons, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs here.
    </string>
    <string name="abhy_4">
        The nursery in this area has 100s of varieties of flowering plants, fruit plants and medicinal and other essential trees. This plants are used to plant trees
all over Anandwan, Somnath, Mulgavhan and the rest are sold. There are 2 lakes in Abhayaranya to maintain groundwater levels and to ensure plentiful water in the area.
The trees in abhayaranya is also responsible for providing usable wood (amounting to 100s of tonnes) from the time Anandwan was established till today. Baba Amte used
to say Be friends with the trees, you cannot have a difference of opinion with them. Keeping this principle in mind and heart, abhyayaranya has, in the period of 30
years, slowly evolved into an enviable landscape, attracting a ton of visitors every year.

       Maharogi Seva Samiti conducts many social awareness and wellness projects under its banner. Strissue is one such project. The donations and help given to MSS
by socially aware well-meaning citizens takes various forms. Of course money is donated but along with that, old and new clothes, utensils, furniture, shoes, books,
electronics, toys, satranji carpets etc. are donated to the organisation. The first stage involves, the classification of all the material and everything useful is

    </string>
    <string name="stre_2">
        The second stage involves focusing on various womens issues. Spreading awareness amongst the women of Anandwan and its neighbouring villages about menstruation
and the various misinformation and superstitions surrounding it. Along with this, awareness is spread about hygiene maintenance and the importance of a balanced and
nutritious diet. One of the most important things done here is educating women about the use of sanitary napkins and making use of cotton as material for producing them
at home. Training is provided to these women to help them to make sanitary napkins as well as use them. Along with Anandwan, the neighbouring villages of Kheregav,
Parsoda, Majra 1,Majra 2, Borda have been surveyed and work has been done there. This department is headed by Pallavi Amte. Sarika Sausagade and 18 others assist her

    <string name="swar_1">
        Swaranandwan is platform for leprosy-stricken, specially albled people where they forget their disability, develop confidence to face the society and thereby
change societys perspective. Swaranandwan makes people bubble with untiring enthusiasm and happiness. Socially marginalized people like blind, deaf and mute,
handicapped, cured leprosy patients are otherwise just like normal people having like-dislikes, wishes, ambitions, hobbies, and special capabilities. But still they
may not get the right opportunity due to the situations around. Though cured of diesease and trained to work independently, the chances of their acceptance back in
the family and society are meagre. Some of these are physically challenged people have melodious voice; some are good dancers while some have ability as a mimic.
Realizing theselatent talents, Dr. Vikas Amte initiated a musical ensemble, Swaranandwan.
    </string>
    <string name="swar_2">
        Initially, Swaranadwan was financially supported by organizations like and #39; Share and care #39; USA and UNICEF through the Government of Maharashtra,
Nouvelle Planete, Switzerland to name a few.The orchestra first debuted on July 14,2002. A renowned poet Kusumagraj term this performance as Anandwan tumchya dwari
whereas Ashok Hande named it as Swaranandwan. Starting with simple performances of Babas poems, Bharat Jodo movement songs, Hindi songs, today this a super large
orchestra, one of kind, incorporating nearly 100 artists challenged with leprosy and different disabilities. It also runs a music academy for studies upto Visharad
level. Swaranandwan has toured throughout the country and has hundreads of performances to its record. Swaranandwan manifests great works with tunes, words, rhythms,
acts and thunderous applause from audience is just unstoppable. For Dr. Vikas Amte , it is a dream in reality with widening horizons. The team not only is not self-reliant
but also contributes to the social cause. As rightly conceptualized by Dr. Vikas Amte , it is a therapeutic theatre rejuvnating the creative talents of socially
marginalized people and rehabilitating them in true sense. Dr. Vikas Amte has planned to establish a special village called Himmatgram for these artists. Sadashiv
Tajne who himself is physically challenged, handles the entire responsibility of Swaranandwan very efficiently.

        A unique blend of artand skill, our wood art department is both awe inspiring as well as thought provoking. Disabled artists breathe life into each of
the beautiful art pieces made by them and surprise and inspire all those whocome here. Mr. Chandramani Maharana is responsible for nurturing this department. A former
Nexalite he lost his arm in a struggle against the police when he was hit by a bullet. He came to Anandwan after contracting leprosy and never looked back. He even
made himself a wooden artificial limb to aid him in his work! Baba gave him the responsibility for this department knowing that Chandramanis family had been involved
in woodworking for generations. Today, the wood art department has been handed over to Mr.Chandramani Maharanas apprentice Mr. Govinda Khopde who handles this
department with flair, skill and passion. Mr. Govinda Khopde joined this department with his wife Mrs.Sunita Khopde after they left Somnath. Mr. Govinda Khopdes is
his bottle art in which creates beautiful art pieces painstakingly joined one by one inside a glass bottle. He creates all the materials himself as well. His other
USP is the intricate carvings he makes out of a single piece of wood. The intricate designs, carvings found in this department and the infinite variety of items
found here are a source of wonder to all those who come here. However, the items found here are not for sold. Baba believed that the art found here is priceless,
because at the end of the day, money cannot measure the talentand effort of the artist. Inspite of being over 50, this couple has not slowed down. In fact, they
keep creating new art in their studio. They have amassed a huge collection of art throughout the years and it will impossible to put a number on the pieces they
have created. But some of the things they have made include a Ganpati made of coconut shells, bamboo stands,table lamps,unique balancing toys, wooden animals, etc.
Our wood art department is unique in the sense that no trees are cut in the name of art. The Khopdes satisfaction reflects clearly on their faces and their
happiness shines through their art. Anandwan truly has the capacity to incorporate every talent in its fold and we are proud to have a variety of talents in our
little family.

    <string name="sneh_1">The number of rehabilitated lepers and patients increased day by day, however the number of people going back home decreased.
        Maharogi Sewa Samiti took all these people in. slowly these people became older and it became necessary to take special care of them.
        With the help of  Help Age India  Snehasavali was established and became a home for the old.
        Snehasavali is a success for humanity.</string>

    <string name="sneh_2">Other than just old people, this old age home also takes responsibility for the bedridden and all their needs including and limited to medicine, residence, food etc.
        Snehasavali includes 4 buildings that follow simple and pleasing patterns of comfortable individual rooms (some for men and some for women) and a garden in the middle of the building for the residents to enjoy.
        Baba Amte fondly referred to these patients as  cold war horses  and said : They may have lost the battle but have won the war against the disease (leprosy).
        The rise of rehabilitated lepers is filled with problems and issues we cannot fathom.
        Some are blind, some are handicapped and some are bedridden.
        Baba Amte believed that these people should die with dignity.</string>

    <string name="sneh_3">More than 400 people are fed, clothed and taken care of happily by the people of Anandwan.
        Even those old people without any support or family who arent patients of leprosy are welcome here.
        Baba Amte and Sadhana Tai went to Snehasavali everyday to meet and talk to residents there.
        To this day, Dr. Vikas Amte and his family, 3 generations after Baba meet the patients regularly.
        After death, the residents last rites are conducted the way they would be by family.
        The dignity and pride allowed to the residents is really reflected by the way they live and their happiness and satisfaction can be seen on their faces.</string>

    <string name="shra_1">Baba wanted to save the wood and pollution that occurs in a funeral pyre.
        Instead a pyre, his hope was to be buried and a tree planted on his memorial. He wanted to be buried with his companions.
        Today, Baba has created an ideal for the world to follow and even today, one can see his thoughts and teachings in action everywhere. </string>

    <string name="shra_2"> Babas , tais memorial,  Anama Vrukshanchi Smaranshila, Anama Muka Kalyanchi Smaranshila has a become a place of awe where people get inspired from their teachings and change their lifestyles to become better people and work for others with selflessness.
        Shraddhavan has become a place of inspiration beyond just the beautiful landscape.
        The area connected to Abhyaranya is called Shraddhavan. This is the final resting place of Baba Amte and Sadhana Tai.
        It is a place of faith, love contemplation, inspiration and awe.</string>

    <string name="shra_3"> Not just Baba and Tai, Count Arthur Tarnowski who worked tirelessly to give dignity and job prospects to the disabled, Babas good friend from Pune Dr. Dhairyashil Shirole, and many of Baba Amtes friends and helpers mostly rehabilitated lepers themselves have been led to rest here.
        Shraddhavan has a large amount of metaphorical importance, because in the same way people here gave their lives up to help others, even in death they gave the trees growing there a new life.
        There is a plant grown in every memorial. In memory of these great people and the wonderful work they did, 1000s of trees were planted here. The place brings great hope and happiness inspite of being the final resting place of many great souls.
        In font of Babas memorial lays the final resting place of the countless unnamed victims of female foeticide called  Anama Muka Kalyanchi Smaranshila  this memorial serves to remind society of gender inequality and its horrific results.
        It urges you to remember these girls and forget this inequality.
        Another memorial lies in front of Babas memorial,  Anama Vrukshanchi Smaranshila which serves as a constant reminder of the countless trees that were cut during the establishment of Anandwan.</string>

    <string name="saibaba_1">Shirdi Saibaba Hospital provides free medical services to leprosy patients, physically handicapped, deaf, mute and blind people, students of schools and colleges and the needy people from surrounding villages.
        Dr. Bharati Amte (MBBS and D.C.H) takes care of this hospital as a medical officer. Her daughter Dr. Sheetal Amte-Karajgi assists her in this work.
        Established in 1978, this is a non-governmental hospital run by MSS and offers medical services to people right from its inception.</string>
    <string name="saibaba_2">After 1990, new hospital building was constructed with the funding received from Shamdasani Foundation and was named as Shirdi Saibaba Hospital.
        It has a capacity of 6 beds with facilities of OPD, laboratory and 3 well-equipped operation theatres. If the patients need urgent expert help, Doctors from Chandrapur are consulted for treatments.
        The local cases requiring urgent surgical treatments and advanced medical investigations are referred to Kasturba Hospital, Sevagram, Wardha. </string>

        Every year, MSS organizes free diagnostic and surgical camps for cataract and reconstructive surgery along with the dental check-up and family planning camps.
        Thousands of peoples from the neighboring districts and states are immensely benefitted from these camps. The hospital started units for making special artificial limbs in 2007for patients needing prosthetic care.
        Here artificial limbs are provided to leprosy-affected patients, needy people of Sandhiniketan and outside community.
        Doctors from Nagpur help in this work to a great extent.
        The expenses for artificial limbs are borne by MSS and the hospital serves patients for 24 hours.</string>

    <string name="satranji_1">Anandwan was expanding day by day and thus, it became parallely important to expand the various activities in the industrial area.
        Dr. Vikas Amte began thinking about activities rehabilitated lepers could be engaged in.mr. Sudhakar Kadu suggested starting a Satranji (mat) department to Baba Amte and Dr. Vikas Amte.
        This idea was enthusiastically nwelcomed by Dr. Vikas Amte and he gave the responsibility of the department in Mr. Kadus able hands. Material was immediately ordered from Nagpur, however, some material couldnt be found.
        Dr. Vikas Amte himself made the materials that werent found.
        In this manner, the Satranji department was established in 1975.</string>
    <string name="satranji_2"> This department is still thriving. Rehabilitated lepers, the disabled and handicapped are running this department in a capable manner and have a made this department a success.
        68 threads are crisscrossed in a 1 foot width on a 54 vertical  tana  threads and horizontal  bana  threads.
        Number 6 (thickness) thread is used to manufacture the Satranjis. The wooden instruments required for manufacture are also made here.
        On an average, one worker manages o make 3 square feet of Satranji in a day. Currently there are about 25 workers in this department.
        Mr. Fago Ganvir has been head of this department for the last 40 years. Along with the large Satranjis, small personal mats are also made here.
        According to the demand, colors and design are customized which makes them very popular in the market.</string>

    <string name="seeta_1">Leprosy is not a repercussion of sins committed in previous lives. Neither is it a curse. It is caused by a bacterium called MycoBacterium Leprae and is an illness just like any other.
        It is not contagious and does not target any particular task, community or gender but affects people with very low immunity or resistance power.
        This bacterium was discovered by Dr. Hensen on 28th’ February, 1873.
        It commonly manifests itself through development of tumors, red patches on skin, fever, body ache, muscular weakness and infection among others.</string>
    <string name="seeta_2"> Once infected nerves become thicker with the skin losing sensation eventually. Our organization primarily works towards the treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients.
        This work was started Baba Amte himself in 1949 when he came here with just 1 lame cow and 6 leprosy patients with him.
        SEETA RATAN HOSPTAL has constantly been working towards treating leprosy afflicted people medically as well as psychologically by working on developing their confidence.
        Dr. Vikas Amte accepted the responsibility of the hospital after attaining his medical degree.
        Since 1982, Dr. Vijay Paul has been working as a special medical officer (SMO) here after undergoing a special training in leprosy treatment at Wardha. </string>
    <string name="seeta_3">The hospital has an OPD, dressing stations, a ward with a 75 bed capacity, a well-equipped operation theatre, pathology lab, digital X-ray unit, physiotherapy unit, dining hall and office since 2002.
        All the patients here are looked after by nurses and assistants staff, who are themselves cured leprosy patients.
        The hospital also follows the unique practice of allocating every patient his own  identity number . </string>

    <string name="print_1">As MSS started to grow, so did its workload. As a result, Baba decided to invest a grand sum of Rupees 50,000 in1963 for setting up a printing press keeping in mind its usefulness in expanding the industrial setup by and by.
        At that time, the unit was managed by Diwarkar Mohani who trained 22 leprosy patients with the know-how of the trade.
        As time passed, the unit started to receive work orders from nearby villages.
        Later, Gangareddy Totawar encouraged and guided the cured leprosy patients to take full responsibility of the unit. </string>
    <string name="print_2">He was succeeded by Ramdas Kandarkar in 2008. From the days of using nail work technology to using Type Setting technology today, the unit has exhibited an exponential growth.
        The high quality of the products manufactured here has also attracted work orders for magazines that are inspired by Sane Gurujis thoughts such as AANTAR BHARATI.
        MSSs publications, stationery for in-house use, office stationery, files and envelopes, journals, for our schools and colleges, notebooks and other printing and binding related work is undertaken here besides taking orders from outside. We have also undertaken work orders from sectors like the Forests and Mineral department.
        Today, the press is run by 18 visually challenged, hearing impaired and cured leprosy patients and generates an annual income of 12-15 lakhs making it a very essential department of MSS.</string>

    <string name="powerloom_1">To improve scope of the cottage industries at Anandwan, it was imperative to increase productivity of the existing units.
        With this thought in mind, Baba decided to upgrade the handloom department to increase cloth production. MSS acquired a government license for setting up a power loom unit with Mumbais textile genius Dilip Herlekar taking responsibility for installing the department at Anandwan at a friends gathering in 1983.
        In the same year, 4 good quality secondhand power looms were purchased and installed here.
        Mr. Herlekar was also instrumental in training the leprosy patients in operating and maintaining those machines.</string>
    <string name="powerloom_2"> The improved cloth production helped in meeting the need of the organization besides facilitating generation of revenue by sale of the surplus produce.
        Later, Sable-Waghire and Company gifted 4 new power looms with the total number being 22 today.
        The excellent quality of the products has also attracted MNC’s like L and T to place orders with us.
        What is extraordinary is the fact that this success has helped in reducing the stigma associated with leprosy by bridging the gap between the two sides significantly.
        The 30 workers in this department help in generating lakhs of rupees as revenue each year with their unmatched hard work and dedication.</string>

    <string name="miya_1">Anandwan has always been about inclusiveness and giving dignity to everyone in society.
        Unity, nationalism and conservation of our environment have always been a priority here.
        However, the ever growing population and the resulting pollution has been a big concern everywhere in the world and we felt the need to be proactive and increase our afforestation efforts.
        In this vein, Dr. Akira Miyawakis  afforestation method of growing a forest 10 times faster with 100% survival became our weapon of choice to battle global warming and rapidly decreasing forest cover of the world. </string>

    <string name="miya_2">Miyawaki  method involves using various local plants and trees and planting them in a 100 x 20 square feet plot.
        The soil is dug up to 3 feet and is filled with wheat or rice husks, cow dung and jeevamrut to form a soil bed.
        This method is assured to create a forest without sacrificing local biodiversity; in fact it embraces local biodiversity and attempts to create a natural forest.
        When this experiment became successful, Miyawaki forests were cultivated on a large scale throughout Anandwan and Somnath.
        The style in which the forest is built involves planting various types of trees which can be broadly classified into 4 types. </string>

    <string name="miya_3">To create a dense forest cover, canopy trees which will eventually grow 50 meters or taller are planted, followed by trees which grow from anywhere between 15 to 50 meters, sub trees which grow from 6 to 15 meters and shrubs which grow from 2 to 6 meters.
        About 3.5 plans fit in a single square meter. They are planted in a zigzag formation to replicate nature.
        The mulching of the husks reduces water requirement significantly and also dissipates heat.
        An efficient use of all the resources including sunlight and the way the forest is planted helps increase the pace of growth multi-fold compared to a natural forest.
        This project will help revive the dying biodiversity and will help the animal and forest conservation efforts.
        This method is 100% organic and is promised to be 30 times denser and 10 times faster than natural forest growth.
        Anandwan has always been the caretaker of the future. We wish to create a world which is a pleasure to live in.
        Through projects like these, we give life to our vision of a better, greener future.</string>

    <string name="mukt_1">Raising children is not easy task. For many of Anandwans physically challenged residents, there are added concerns and challenges.
        Recognizing the difficulties faced by these parents, Maharogi Seva Samiti : Muktangan Anganwadi was introduced in 2010.
        The intention behind Muktangan Anganwadi is to help overall physical and mental well-being and advancement of the kids who come there.
        A lot of the couples who have been rehabilitated here are engaged in some or the other work.</string>
    <string name="mukt_2"> Muktangan Anganwadi is where such working parents send their children.
        This is a unique venture because it isnt just a daycare for the children but a wellness centre especially for the children of the disabled.
        Muktangan Anganwadi compensates wherever the parents of these children are unable tom do so.
        Special attention is given to the health and overall well-being of children from ages 1-3. To attend to the training required for child development, 3 experts from the institution : Umeed  (Hope) have been engaged here.
        Special attention is paid to the children of the deaf and dumb so they may feel heard</string>
    <string name="mukt_3">. Through continuous assessment and constant attention both special talents and faults are recognized and efforts are made to either encourage or develop the same and lead the children to a successful life.
        Diet is also a primary focus here. Children are fed various different and nutritious foods and the cook makes as any as a 100 different varieties of items. Efforts are made to include a diet including milk, fruits etc containing various vitamins and essential nutrients.
        Parents are educated about raising the children and ensuring their well-being.
        Along with a healthy diet, children are given education and special effort is made to inculcate and nurture arts and sports activities.</string>

    <string name="hand_posters_1">The successful establishment of the greeting cards department was the motivation behind setting up of an independent poster department.
        The department is headed by Sheikh Gani Khan, earlier an artist in the greeting cards section.
        Recycled plastic and agriculture waste is used for making posters. Other non-biodegradable objects like used saline-bottles, cold drink bottle caps, guthka wrappers, cigarette packets are used to make chandeliers, different craftworks, etc.
        all these ingenious ideas gave a huge impetus to the work here and helped them gain massive popularity in a short span of time.</string>
    <string name="hand_posters_2"> Today, more than 30 designs are visible in a poster section and many of these are available for sale as well.
        All the 10 artists working here are differently able or cured leprosy patients and create more than a 100 beautiful posters every month.
        Dr Vikas Amte is still actively involved in the creation of few new designs every year. We have also successfully experimented with using bio-medical waste in the form of screen printing on X-ray films for making calendars.
        One of Sheikh Gani Khans masterpieces includes creation of portraits without any use of color.
        Instead, he uses dried banana leaves, rice husks and com coverings to enhance minute facial details of many famous personalities.
        It takes Gani 10 straight days of hard labor to create a masterpiece usually.
        This department is commonly called a place for makeovers of waste products into beautiful masterpieces.</string>

    <string name="hand_greetings_1">Greeting cards have always been considered a more personalized and affectionate medium of expression of emotions.
        It is this very thought that motivated Dr. Vikas Amte to use his mode for Anandwan to communicate both internally as well as with the outside world.
        This would not only facilitate building deeper relations with Anandwans  fraternity, donors and friends but also give an impetus to increase productivity sale.
        Ideas for different designs were initially adopted from greetings that were sent to MSS were reproduced onto smaller sizes with the use of waste products as raw materials.</string>
    <string name="hand_greetings_2"> For 42 years, Ramesh Amru with Dr. Vikas Amte has spearheaded the growth of this department by conquering the impediments posed by manifestation of leprosy onto his body.
        On Dr. Vikas Amte’s insistence, waste produced from other departments was also used to create exquisite pieces of art. Organic substances like banana, leaves, ripped clothes, dried barks, colored paper, etc are the main raw materials that are being used here.
        The department specializes in creating cards out of sewing threads onto paper and every year.
        Ramesh Amru and his team strive to create 5-6 new designs having created more than a 100 designs so far. Big festivals like Diwali and New Year understandably render a huge market for these products.
        Besides, these cards are in high demand at Mumbais  Grahak Peths, an yearly exhibition, where we are able to see more than 60,000 cards each year in the price range between 20-41. Handcrafted paper made notepads, letter pads, paper diaries, are some of the other objects produced by the 30 artists working here. These cards have actually helped Anandwan in bridging the gap between its reality and perception by the world outside.
        Ramesh Amru considers Dr. Vikas Amte as his inspiration and does not shy away from admitting this ever.</string>

    <string name="handlooms_1">The skillful work by the rehabilitated lepers of Anandwan impressed the country as well as the entire world. The inspiring stories of Anandwan spread, and the number of patients began to rapidly increase.
        This led to a direct increase in Maharogi Seva Samiti’s economic burden.
        Compensate for the increasing need for jobs as well as to reduce the economic burden on the organization, Baba Amte decided to introduce spinning (turning cotton to thread) and handlooms to Anandwan besides agriculture, which was already thriving.</string>
    <string name="handlooms_2"> Some residents from the weaving community decided to take responsibility and run the handlooms.
        An additional advantage was the self-sufficiency that came to Anandwan with the need for clothes for the residents, producing gauze and bandages in Hemalkasa, Somnath and Ashokwan, relatively new ventures at the time.
        This work continues till date. Currently 26 disabled and rehabilitated lepers including 7 women are working on making Shabnam bags, personal mats, bedsheets, rugs (Galichas), blankets, towels, napkins, panchas  ,  lungis , shirting etc. the raw material from Nagpur is turned into finished products here.</string>
    <string name="handlooms_3">Previously, colored thread had to be ordered, however, now that processes take place here as well.
        There are 22 handlooms which include all a tall beam for threads, charkhas to make thread rolls.
        The cloth manufactured here are in immense demand. The workers work according to their comfort and capability and are paid accordingly, Mr. Nana Makte was in charge of the handlooms for a long period of time, and after him, his apprentices have taken responsibility of the handlooms.
        Various well wishers of Anandwan use these materials for special occasions and in their daily lives.
        Because of the first class quality, the skillful work and the goodwill for Anandwan, sales here are superb.</string>

    <string name="mega_1">Anandwan subscribers to the saying : Those who dine together, stay together .
        Every single person who stays here is a part of the Anandwan family and is thus welcome to enjoy the community dining experience.
        As the Anandwan family began to grow and expand with time, Baba built the rehabilitated leprosy afflicted, disabled citizens homes and communities as they started settling down, getting married and having children. </string>
    <string name="mega_2">The different communes like Sukhsadan, Muktisadan, Krushi Niketan, Mitrangan and the guest mess all came to have their own kitchens and canteens.
        This resulted in a difference in the food in different places. This continued for many years.
        However, everyone felt like the whole village should dine as one and this thought gave birth to the proposal for a  Megakitchen .
        Nouvelle plan  te, Switzerland and Fedvaco made this dream a reality and with their help, our Megakitchen was built in 2004.
        Typically, one can expect 3 square meals a day here,
        Everything from breakfast, tea, roti , vegetables, dal, rice etc is served everyday.</string>
    <string name="mega_3">  More than 2000 people currently dine here. For those who find coming to the kitchen inconvenient, food is delivered to their area  and for some others  Tiffins  are given.
        All rations required making the nutritious, tasty and balanced variety of food found here is bought from Nagpur and Warora.
        The Megakitchen makes use of advanced technology like roti makers, biogas and solar panels to cook food.
        These methods have reduced LPG use by around 75%. 2 cooks and more than a 100 helpers and cleaners work here.
        The Megakitchen has a big dining hall, clean filtered drinking water, a large kitchen area and a godown.
        The Megakitchen encourages the feeling of unity and helps reduce manpower and wastage of food as well.
        The Megakitchen is one of the places that encapsulate what Anandwan is truly about. A feeling of community and family.</string>

    <string name="sandhi_1">BABA Amte always worked towards making the lives of lepers independent and ensured that they would live in a dignified manner.
        Count Arthur Tarnowski  a foreigner himself affected by polio and thus paralyzed from the waist down, was greatly inspired by Baba Amte and Anandwan.
        It filled his heart with joy to see lepers living their lives in a dignified and fulfilled manner, so much so that he knew that if there was anyone in the world who could build a
        sustainable institution for the disabled, to learn, grow and thrive, it was Baba Amte. </string>
    <string name="sandhi_2">He requested Baba Amte to consider taking up the cause for the disabled as well.
        Baba Amte was of the opinion that though someone may be disabled, it doesnt necessarily mean, they cannot be self sufficient, in fact they are capable of leading life independently and finding the meaning of life.
        And so, it was decided that Anandwan would build its own institution for the disabled.
        In 1967, Count Arthur Tarnowskis book : The Unbeaten Track , was published and was successful. </string>
    <string name="sandhi_3">A total sum of Rs. 15 lakhs collected by the Count as book royalty was then donated to MSS to begin work on the training center as well as residential quarters for the disabled,
        Baba Amte was of the opinion that be it lepers or the disabled, society must set aside its pre-conceived notions and give them a chance, not charity.
        Thus, the training center was named  Sandhiniketan  or the home for opportunity.
        Work on this project was completed in the year 1970. Free residence and jobs are given to the disabled.
        In this venture, Mr. Tarnowskis  Take Heart foundation continues to back MSS.
        Courses like fashion designing, tailoring, wireman, wielding, weaving, printing press, leather works, housekeeping, medical assistant, caregiver, handicrafts are taught Mr. Sadashiv Tajane was the first student of the institution.</string>
    <string name="sandhi_4"> He later went on to become the principal of this institution in1995.
        Mr. Ravindra Nalgintavar is currently the principal of this fine institution.
        The institution which was independently run by the MSS later began to get funding and recognition from the government.
        The government provides funding for 85 trainees. However the training center has more than 100 students.
        In addition to this, psychological guidance is given to the trainees. The focus remains on making them as self- sufficient and economically independent as possible.
        Artificial limbs are provided to the trainees as required to make their lives simpler and make it easier for them to work.
        After the completion of the course, the institute attempts to place every student.
        Additionally, efforts are made to help with loan applications in case student wishes to start a business.
        Till date, hundreds of students have been placed in over 78 different business fields all over places like Nagpur and Pune.
        These placements have resulted in the disabled trainees getting dignified jobs and thus, living independent lives.</string>

    <string name="metal_1">IN 1960 ALONG WITH Anandwans  Tin Can Project  , a project where cans to store goods were made out of tin, the metal fabrication department was established.
        In the beginning the metal fabrication department was capable only of satisfying the residents demand.
        Because wood was so unwieldy to work with, the demand for metal products increased rapidly.
        Mr. Giridhar Raut, a rehabilitated leper, took charge of the department.
        The department was established, but nobody had any training. In the beginning, drawings were made and followed through. </string>
    <string name="metal_2">These experiments were surprisingly successful. The acquisition of a wielding machine sparked a lot of creativity and passion amongst the workers and they began to experiment extensively.
        A direct result of these experiments was the manufacture of everything from iron chairs to car repair.
        Air coolers, deep freezers, and even Air conditioners were made here. For a few years, Anandwan even assembled thermostats for Voltas for a few years.
        The infinite variety of items and innovations in this department are a testament to Dr. Vikas Amtes vision. </string>
    <string name="metal_3">The biggest success of this department is perhaps the 3 wheeled cycles.
        The introduction of the 3 wheeled cycle to Anandwan brought a lot of happiness an brought a lot of positivity among the disabled, handicapped residents.
        The 3 wheeled cycle gave them the gift of independence and movement, something we take for granted. The production as impressive and satisfied not only the demand of the residents of Anandwan, but subsequently were put up for sale.
        This helped spread the positive impact of the 3 wheeled cycles everywhere, even outside Anandwan. Something special to be noted about this department is that cycle repair, removing punctures is done here free of charge and as quickly as possible.
        Anandwans  metal fabrication department is one of the only factors in Maharashtra with a production capacity of more than a 1000, 3 wheeled cycles per year.  The Social Welfare department of Maharashtra directly gives their orders to Anandwan, without any tender.
        Some of the work taking place in the metal fabrication department currently includes iron beds, around 100 cupboards, rums to store grains, items made of tin, making chairs as well as any weaving required to manufacture the chairs, wielding etc.
        Mr. Prashant Deshmukh heads this department and currently, around 35 workers are engage in manufacture here. Raw material is acquired here from Nagpur, and mostly, orders are placed here by the government.
        This department satisfies the demand not just in Anandwan, but manages to satisfy the demand in Hemalkasa, Somnath, Ashokwan, Nagepalli, and Mulgavhan.</string>

    <string name="bag_1">Starting new ventures and replicating them if successful is Anandwans motto.The bag and cushion section is a golden anandwan of the same. Anandwan is
responsible for the rehabilitation of many handicapped and disabled people. Mr.Maniram Lunje, a worker in the leather department is one of them.
Baba Amte had once received a leather bag as a gift from the Birlas. When Baba showed Mr.Lunje the same, he replicated it exactly and brought it to
Baba and proved that we could produce quality leather bags in Anandwan.In 1985, an independent Bag and cushion section was establised. Leather purses,
bags,backpacks,office bags etc.Along with leather, the factory began producing Rexin.</string>
    <string name="bag_2">Rexin is cheaper than leather and so the demand for rexin
products began increasing rapidly. The cushions required by Anandwan too are manufactured here.  8 disabled workers are engaged in manufacture here
and they work with the help of sewing machines. These workers have all been trained here itself. Mr.Maniram Lunje has a talent for sewing and design.
He makes an effort to keep abreast with the latest designs in the market and reproduce them here. The variety fo goods produced is staggering and
impressive. It is in high demand here at Anandwan among residents and guests alike.
    </string>

    <string name="blind_school_1">Apart from leprosy-afflicted people,many other physically challenged and neglected categories of society need
help and opportunity. Realising this need, Baba Amte started a blind school in 1966. It was the first blind school of the time in Central
India. In 1970, as a result of relentless efforts of MSS, Samajkalyan Sanchanalay, Pune granted permission to this school. Baba initially
appointed Mukund Vaishampayan as Head of the school. Later Sudhakar Kadu handled this responsibility. Children from surrounding districts like Chandrapur,
Gadchiroli,Nagpur,Bhandara,Gondiya and Yavatmal come to this school. Their physical limitation is never a restraining factor.</string>
    <string name="blind_school_2">These children treated just
like other normal kids and made part of all the activities of Anandwan. Along with this, Anandwan takes care of their health as well. Since 2001-02,
Social Welfare Department has granted funding for educational material,stay,food,health and educational excursions of 75 students and additional 25 students
are allowed on non-grant basis. The expenses of these 25 students is taken care by MSS.</string>
    <string name="blind_school_3">The stay in well-equipped hostel and the education eith the help of
latest teaching aids, CDs,DVDs and brail script, is provided upto 10 th standard. The students are also trained in other activities like music, sports, dance
etc. Presently Sevakram Bandgar shoulders the responsibility of the school. With a well-maintained library,expert teachers and special teachers appointed by
organization, Anand Blind School is constantly helping hundreds of blind children to get good education and be self-reliant in  their life.
    </string>

    <string name="deaf_mute_school_1">Education is very important to establish yourself in the society. Nobody should be deprived of the education , was Babas opinion. After successful start
of Anand Blind School, Baba decided to start a school for deaf and mute children. Organization called Netherland Committeefor Kinder Postal funded for school
building and instruments required for deaf and mute children and the school was started on 1 st July 1983. In 1995, the permission was granted upto 5 th grade and
in 2006, permission till 10 th grade was granted. Social Welfare Department funds 75 students for educational aids, stay, food, health etc.</string>
    <string name="deaf_mute_school_2">Unfunded students are taken care by the organization. Presently more than 100 students are studying in this school. All the students acn avail of well-equipped
hostel facility, nutritious food, clothes etc. School continuously upgrades itself understanding the newer teaching technologies and aids being developed for
deaf and mute children. Apart from government teachers, organization also appoints teachers and sign language translator to train studnets in art, craft,
sports, etc. The organization strives to rehabilitate needy people by making them self-reliant and raising their standard of living. The option of vocational
training at Sandhiniketan is also made available to these students. Presently, a cured leprosy patient Sopan Hange heads the school.</string>

    <string name="agriculture_1">The increasing population and resulting need for an increase in food production is a national problem. This issue was close to Babas heart and bothered him
greatly. He realised that unless agriculture is modernised and improved these problems cannot be solved. At the time, colleges teaching agriculture sciences
were very rare. On the village level, ensuring that farming tradition remained alive had become a difficult task. If the youth were educated, they often used
education to get out of the agriculture business. Baba wished for the youth to not only be engaged in agriculture beacuase of lack of opportunities or
education but to improve agriculture by gaining  education and knowledge in the field. Providing top quality agricultural education was a way of ensuring
that agricultural tradition remains not just alive, but thrives in India.</string>
    <string name="agriculture_2">With this intention, Baba decided to start an agricultural department in Anandniketan
college in 1965-66. The technology, the fields and all the other equipment necessary for training was provided in Anandwan itself. In 1969, Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh
Krushi Vidyapeeth, Akola was established and this department  was connected to it. This department was then converted into Anandniketan Agricultural College,
a college dedicated to the agricultural sciences. Through his amiable connections at Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krushi Vidyapeeth, Baba managed to build a
formidable teaching staffand gather people who were the best in there field to teach here. Babas vision for the college was that the youth who will graduate from
here will go back to his village as an ambassador for modern agricultural methods and systems.</string>
    <string name="agriculture_3">His hope was that these students will spread their knowledge
and help the farmers in thier region, thus improving the lives of farmers all over India. The students from the very first batch of Anandnikeatan Agricultural College,
gained the first and second rank among all the students in Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krushi Vidyapeeth. This tradition of being rank holders is alive even today.
Anandniketan Agricultural College follows the syllabus, rules and conditions layed down by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Maharashtra
Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune and Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krushi Vidyapeeth. A four year, 8 semester B.Sc Agriculture full-time degree
course is offered here.</string>

    <string name="arts_college_1">When Baba set up the MSS, neither did Warora nor any other nearby village offeredan opportunity to receive higher education. Those who were interested had
no option but to go either Chandrapur or Nagpur to pursue higher education. In order to prevent the youth of Anandwan, nearby tribal areas and poor villages
from losing out due to lack of options, Baba started this college in 1964. To accomplish Babas vision, MSS arranged for 2 lakh rupees through money saved by
leprosy patients along with the Tin Can project benefits. 53 acres of land was purchased for the college project and the work was started towards its
completion. The magnificent building we see today is the creation of our own leprosy patients for whom Baba said, This College is a gift from the leprosy
patients to the society. Those who study here will witness the creativity and hard work of these leprosy patients and this will help in lessening the hatred
in their hearts towards them.</string>
    <string name="arts_college_2">Anand Niketan Science, Arts and Commerce College was granted recognition by the University Council of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj
University, Nagpur immediately after it came into being and the batch started their curriculum in 1964-1965. Baba appointed the very best professors and
lecturers as the college staff and Dr. Vikas and Dr. Prakash Amte happened to be the students of the first batch. Till today, many students have graduated
from this college and many more seek admission every year. Besides imparting formal education, college also runs a Students Council, NSS, NCC, Science Forum,
a Literature Society, Womens Studies, Population Studies and many other programs. Today, Anand Niketan College is continuously gaining acclaim and accreditations
by successfully implementing new ideas and technologies. The main college body is governed by MSS. The college is now affiliated With Gondwana University of
Gadchiroli district and is the most reputed college under its umbrella.
</string>

    <string name="footware_1">Many of the leprosy patients who come to Anandwan have wounds on their feet, hands and other body parts as a manifestation of contracting leprosy. As a result,
appropriate footwear became a basic need for these patients, to care for those wounds. However, due to lack of adequate funds with the organization in the
beginning, it was not possible to buy each and every patient a new pair of shoes. Soon, Baba came upwith an innovative idea to utilize waste tires for
manifacturing footwear. Luckily, a few of the leprosy patients happened to be shoemakers by profession and as a result, this department came into existence
and is one of the oldest departments in Anandwan. Unsurprisingly, Baba himself began to wear these very chappals until MCR i.e. microcellular rubber was used
to refine the quality of the footwear manufactured here. Chappals made with MCR, are very soft and are created without the use of nails thus preventing
exacerbation of wounds. MCR footwear is also advised for diabetic patients rendering a huge demand for this product.</string>
    <string name="footware_2">Today, the rubber used to manufacture
chappals is imported from the local market whereas earlier it had to be produred from Chennai and Kolkata. The challenge to continuously create new and
attractive designs was eliminated gradually by observing and replicating the designs of the footwear worn by the visitors. Since then, our footwear has become
more popular in the market. The school for vocational training - Sandhiniketan also imparts training to youth interested in learning this art. What can be
termed as an extraordinary achievement is the fact that the people who are working in the footwear department today do not belong to any one caste such as
Chambhars who were traditionally typecast as shoemakers since times immemorial: when ones caste dictated ones profession. Today, these artists are
dexterous at making footwear even for differently abled people by taking their foot measurement. Many of the people in Anandwan also use footwear made by them.
</string>

    <string name="dairy_1">Milk is a staple part of most Indians diets. However, getting milk was an uphill task as Anandwan was set up far from other human settlements. This difficulty
was noticed by Vinoba Bhave and he then gave Baba the money to buy a cow. Baba Amte bought a lame cow with this money and thus, Anandwans dairy was established
in 1951 and its activities were conducted alongside agriculture which was Anandwans main business at the time. The increase in cows and buffaloes and the
sale of milk would have definitely helped with money, however Babas main intention behind starting the dairy was to bring Anandwan in contact with the outside
world and mainstream society. People bought the top quality milk in the beginning, however once they found out this milk came from Anandwan they were very
hesitant to buy it. They were afraid to drink the milk extracted by rehabilitated lepers and were especially hesitant about giving it to their children.
</string>

    <string name="dairy_2">Purchase completely stopped because of this. This situation led to Sadhna tai herself milking the cows, buffaloes. People confirmed that this was the case
before resuming purchase. With the expansion of Anandwan, sales reduced. Mr. Narayan Hakke took charge of the dairy during thid time.Post 2009, MSS decided to expand
the dairy and to get more cows and buffaloes. Expansion of the dairy meant preparing high protein feed for the animals first. The dairy was built in a sustainable
manner with fantastic ventilation and stable infrastucture. Primarily, the hygiene here is impeccable and dedicatedly maintained. Talented vets take care of the
overall health of the animals. Every early morning and evening the animals are treated to soothing classical music. The dairy is run in a very modern manner.
The cows and buffaloes are given token numbers and their produce is observed. These practices have resulted in an increasing of milk production. A lot of these
animals have won many prizes in fairs and exhibitions. After Anandwans demand was satisfied, milk began to be sold outside.</string>

    <string name="dairy_3">The remainder was used to produce
various milk products. However, once the demand for milk rose again, production of milk products was stopped. In 2009, the expanded and improved dairy made
32 lac rupees and in 2012-13, this number rose to more than 1 crore. Presently, milk is sold at rs 60 a litre. 800 litres milk is produced on a daily basis.
Since 2014, regular milk testing for fat content, glucose, protein, water, minerals etc is conducted. The natural waste in this department is used to creat
biogas. Chickens have also been kept in the dairy. They eat insects, ticks etc and help maintain the health of the animals. They also produce eggs. An ideal
model for agriculture, dairy and poultry farming has been attempted here. The science of dairy farming is taught and training is given to encourage youth
from village to take this up as a career.This also increases employment opportunities in the area. Mr. Gajanan Vasu is currently heading this department.</string>

    <string name="gokul_1">Anandwan is an institution which believes in being there for those who have no-one.Anandwan was establised by Baba Amte to be a firm support,a familly and a community
for those who suffer from leprosy. with the same intention,Gokul was born.Tai and Baba Amte were well aware of the reality of life for orphans.They were worried about
the future of such children and wished to give them a home to call their own,education and a chance of a better future.Sometimes,it became important to take care of the
children of some lepers as the research for leprosy was not advanced enough and the cause for the same had not been found by science at the time.Once the research and
experience showed that the children would not suffer like their parents,they were returned to their respective homes.In 1983, Some school children from Mumbai saved their
pocket money to donate.</string>
    <string name="gokul_2">They gave the sum to the president of saneguruji Kathamala Mr.Prakash Mohadikar to give Baba Amte.This money was used to construct Gokuls building,
All the children from Gokul are doing very well and currently 7 kids residing here are the children of lepers and 7 are orphans. Mr.Madhav Kavishwar and his wife Mrs.
Neelatai Kavishwar have been taking care of the Gokul family for many years now.Along with their primary needs,the childrens educational needs are also fulfilled here.
When the children grow up,MSS Also takes responsibility of rehabilitation these children intosociety. Gokul prides itself on being a home to the children who come here.

    <string name="biogas_1">Anandvan function on two basic principles-local production of everything required for basic sustenance of life and utilization of all waste products to reduce waste to a
bare minimum.with this thought in mind,the Biogas project was established in order to utilize kitchen waste and cow dung from dairy in 1978 under the guidance of Dr.Vikas
Amte and Devendrabhai Gupta,an expert in biogas technology,the wholehearted dedication and hard work of te cured leprosy patient has brought this project into being.with
the passage of time,regular changes werw incorporated at the plant.Today,the new technology used by us is created with the help of kirloskar integreated Technology
limited.</string>
    <string name="biogas_2">Currently,we produce 150 Kgs i.e 400m 3 of biogas by treating 5 tons of cow dung, 3 tons of kitchen waste from local market and food waste from our commumes every
day.Also 24 toilets are connected to this project.After the primary and secondary process is completed,the biogas is stored in a 150 kg capacity balloon.the byproduct-slurry
is not discarded and rather used as organic manure for our agriculture thus,ensuring a healthy crop.Besides,regular use of biogas for making food at Mega kitchen has also
helped in reduction of our consumption significantly.
</string>

    <string name="carpentry_1">Anandvan is village that was established on the function of hard and dignity. This was the place for rehabilitated lepers,the handicapped lepers, the handicapped or disabled
tc find dignity in labour and life.Agriculture was the primary occupation at Anandwan and the need of wood for agricultural equipment,construction for new residences became the
need of the hour.Baba Amte insisted that everything needed for MSS,should be made here at Anandawan,Some of the rehabillitated patients had some experience in carpentry,and so,
the equipment and wood required for the new residences began to be made here.Some of the things made here.</string>
    <string name="carpentry_2">Some include the framework for construction,doors,windows and before the
metal fabrication department was established,even the beds,tables and cupboards were made here.Since the entire organisation,including the residences of the patients used wood
for just about everything,the burden and worklosd of this department was intense, The materials need at Hemalkasa,Somnath,Ashokwan were also manufactured here.Mr,Namdevrao Tagad was
the first te take charge of this department. Now, Mr Anandrao Chaudhary is currently in charge and 12 workers work here. This deprtment is still in high demand and is running
smoothly due to various modernisations through time. The ban on cutting of forest wood, has forced the workers to stick to plywood. Along with the manufacture of doors, windows etc, a
large amount of repair work also takes place here.</string>

    <string name="woolart_1">The school for the deaf and mute children saw the light of day in 1983. Art oriented education became the foundation of their curriculum, given the natural
inclination exhibited by most of these children towards it. As a result, handicraft lessons were initiated to provide them a medium to exhibit their creativity.
Motivated by Dr. Bharti Amte, Mangala Dumre, a teacher in the deaf and mute school began working here. Gradually, girls from the school who had been rehabilitated
here and were adept at wool work joined the department.</string>
    <string name="woolart_2">department. The heavy winter of Anandwan made it imperative to produce woolens. Half and full sweaters, mufflers, caps,
small frocks, jackets, baby sets for toddlers are some of the products created here in exquisite designs. Approximately, 50-60 woolen sets are created every month
for sale. Today, four differently abled ladies work on 3 machines in this department. These donated machines have helped in increasing productivity by a huge margin.
The raw material is procured from Nagpur while the new design samples experimented here are prepared at wardha.
</string>

    <string name="zilla_1">Baba Amte as well his entire family has always been very passionate about education. It was very important to them to ensure that the children of those rehabilitated
at Anandwan, the children from the Gokul orphanage as well the children from the neighbouring villages should be given first-class educational opportunities atleast but
not limited to the primary level. The Zilla Parishad School was established as early as 1984 with this intention. From a humble beginning of of 25 students, now, more
than 400 students are enrolled in the school. This school is popular not just amongst the residents of Anandwan, but with people from the neighbouring villages as well.
The ZP school provides education from standards from 1 to 8 and is Semi-English medium to promote familiarity with both the mother tongue as well as the lingua franca
of the World-English.</string>
    <string name="zilla_2">Along with a quality education, emphasis is given on a healthy school lunch, arts and sports among other extra curriculars. The students win many
accolades and laurels for the school. The school is a well equipped building with a hand wash center, canteen, clean drinking water, hall, etc. It has been credited
with the A Grade for its outstanding performance. Here, daily prayers takes place in Marathi and English alternatively. Under the able guidance of principal Geeta
Pande and a team of teachers who care not just about providing quality education but holistic guidance and love to their students, Zilla Parishad school, Anandwan is
growing from strength to strength everyday. The residents of Anandwan, too, encourage all new projects and activities undertaken by the school.

    <string name="aapulki_1">A commune specially built for women, to give them a comfortable home and privacy. Apulki was established after sneh-savali started getting overcrowded. </string>
    <string name="aapulki_2">. It was built using the money raised by the ‘Swaranandwan’ orchestra. The residents here are provided with electricity, housing, food water etc.</string>

    <string name="sukhsadan_1">This was the first commune established in Anandwan. The communes here were designed for the rehabilitated leprosy-afflicted and disabled people. Baba had arranged for two young couples and one older couple to stay in one home thus forming a traditional Indian joint-family."1</string>
    <string name="sukhsadan_2">This way, family relations could be preserved and understood by those who were otherwise disowned by their blood relatives outside Anandwan. The joint-family structure ensures that the older couple can be taken care of by their “children”.</string>

    <string name="anlake_1">Water conservation is of utmost importance for the development of the region due to the scarcity of water.</string>
    <string name="anlake_2">The land on which Anandwan stands was originally barren, abandoned quarry with no surface water. Through the painstaking efforts by early rehabilitated residents, wells were dug to provide water for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes. Considering the growing requirement of water, reservoirs were built which helped in recharging ground water of the region thus providing water security even during a drought year. More than 30 reservoirs have been built across various project locations of MSS. These reservoirs apart from supplying and recharging water also offer reprieve to the surrounding flora and fauna.</string>
    <string name="anlake_3"> To enhance the catchment of reservoirs, small check dams were developed. These dams are low in cost and easy-to-build and are made using old tyres and plastic waste. With the help of these check dams’ water catchment of reservoirs has been enhanced manifold thus providing water security to the surrounding areas.</string>
    <string name="anlake_4">All the drains in Anandwan converge into two reservoirs, through a unique bio filtration system the water is treated and the fishes in the reservoir further cleanse the water thus allowing the water to be utilized for irrigation of farms. Also, sale of fishes creates livelihood opportunities.</string>

    <string name="solar_1">The Vidarbha region in India is blessed with perfect geography for optimal utilization of solar energy. Various applications have been developed and deployed utilizing solar power for steam-based cooking, heating water and generating electricity to power utilities.</string>
    <string name="solar_2">In the year 2016, Anandwan was awarded the Most Innovative Project of The Year by American Association of Energy Engineers for implementing integrated solar based project in Anandwan. The solar project has significantly helped in reducing energy costs and has created a benchmark for other villages to replicate.</string>

    <string name="ssq">The idea of `How to build/develop a man` found its roots when Baba saw the emptiness of the supple minds of youth, who were being pushed away from the idea of living a community centered and development oriented life due to prevailing socio-economic conditions and education system. Baba would always argue that if people affected with leprosy and other disabilities could carve out an oasis out of barren land and pioneer the paradigms of development, then why can`t people especially the youngsters who have able minds and bodies build a modern responsible and inclusive nation.\n\nThe solution was to kindle the young hearts by channelling their anxieties, desperation and raw energy on the path of development</string>

    <string name="ss6">This vision came to realization through "Shram Sanskar Chhavani" which Baba often refered to as a factory for transforming youngsters into sensitive, responsible, development oriented citizens. This was achieved by instilling the value of hard labor in their hearts and minds.</string>
    <string name="ss7">`Shram Sanskar Chhavani` is a week-long annual boot camp where young boys and girls from all over the country congregate, make friends, get sensitized and work in harmony with nature, building check dams, cultivating barren land, cleaning forests and digging lakes through Shramadan (hard labor). Working together, regardless of caste, creed and religion, helps them to develop empathy, secular values, national integration and sensitization towards the marginalized section of society and environment. Participants learn about current and potential challenges confronting the society and are encouraged to ideate and develop sustainable solution through interaction with their peers and subject matter experts on topics ranging from education, health care, livelihoods, agriculture, rural development and environmental conservation.</string>

    <string name="ucn">Literally...Anandwan is a Forest of Joy". Sandhiniketan where I work is a "Home of Opportunity"...
        Anandwan has given me a big canvas of "Sandhiniketan" with various color shades of differently abled children, allowing me to develop my passion for teaching without any boundaries. I have found a new way of life.Working with our deaf, blind and physically challenged children, I get pleasantly surprised daily looking at their positive attitude and finding joy in
        small things. Every day in Anandwan teaches you something that will help you lead a meaningful life This has been an "Experience of a Lifetime for me!</string>

    <string name="ucn2">Nothing so far has given me as much work satisfaction as being able to serve the ones who are not able to access
                        healthcare facilities because of being differently abled or afflicted by diseases like leprosy. Anandwan has provided me a perfect platform
                        not just to treat people as a dentist but also to increase oral hygiene awareness, introduce rural population to modern
                        treatment techniques and facilities and reduce common myths and assumptions. And that is just the professional aspect...
                        This place and people have that power and energy to change you for the better- emotionally, spiritually,
